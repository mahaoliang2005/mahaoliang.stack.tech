# 雅思学习｜心得

## ∆口语

口语对于我来说是最难的部分，不仅仅有社恐的因素，还有 **oral speaking** 的语速问题（over 120 words per minute is standard）。

> * 特别要注意的是**口音**并不太重要，重要的是 **例子！！栗子！！真实例子！！** 不管是 part 1，part 2，还是 part 3，都需要例子，只不过每个 part 的例子各有区别罢了。区别后面讲。
> * 不能有太多的**停顿**，一个问题最多两个停顿，多了就有可能扣分，再多些考官就会 cut you out，然后你的心态就可能会崩，导致后面答题的状态，引发蝴蝶效应。
> * 注意**时间限制**，part one 和 part three 一个问题回答一分钟左右，没有**准备时间**！！！part two 有一分钟的准备时间，给一张纸让考生写提示词，讲述时可以看。

### Part 1

在 part 1 时，举例子只用举自己的轻身例子，并用第一**人称讲述**。讲述时，时态讲错了不用管，因为不重要，重要的是要讲述**具体细节**

> * 例如，说出去吃饭时要说清楚和谁去（who），为什么去（why），什么时候去的（when），去哪里吃（where），吃的什么类型的餐厅的什么菜 (what)，心情如何（how），即**6W 要素**。
>
> * eg. I usually hang out with my best friend, Tom, to have a big meal on weekends in a shopping centre like the Coastal City in Nan Shan district in Shenzhen because the food in school's canteen is tasteless. And we always go to the Green Tea restaurant there, a famous chinese restaurant, for having some crispy chicken, spicy tofu, or the boiled Fish with Sichuan pickles. That really makes me a happy mood to face the disgusting food next week in school.

在上面的例子中，我每提出一个概念都给出了解释或是具体的事物。例如，friend 是 Tom，a shopping centre 是深圳南山区的海岸城 the Coastal City，the Green Tea restaurant 是一家中餐厅。以上就是我所说的**具体细节**，就是得分要点。没有细节口语就不可能上 6 分，只有 5 分。

### Part 2

在 part 2 时，也要举**亲身经历**，题目怎么问就怎么答，讲出**具体细节**就可以了。准备时，最好四十秒写提示词，二十秒再在脑中过一遍，以免出现太多停顿。

例如题目：**Describe a daily routine that you enjoy**

**You should say, what you do, when it became your daily routine, whether you will change it in the future, and explain why you enjoy it**

> eg.
>
> * The daily routine I am going to tell you about is that I ***jog*** at around 6 pm nearly every afternoon. At that time, the sun has already started sinking, but the darkness has not fallen, creating a mild temperature. Right next to my community is ***a huge park*** stretching over 2 kilometers, which is a perfect place to run around. Sometimes, I would also go to the ***stadium*** several blocks away. It has a standard 400-meter track, enabling me to precisely calculate the distance and speed.
>
> * I developed this habit several months ago when I accidentally caught ***Xiaoming*** doing some warm-up activities at the side of the street on my way back from the library. I pulled over my ***electric bicycle*** and asked what he was doing. He said he was going to start his daily jogging and ***invited*** me to jog together. I thought, why not. But what I did not expect was that I overestimated my ***stamina***. After one kilometer, I felt I could not breathe and had to give up. But since then, I have jogged with him almost every day.
>
> * I do not think I will change this daily routine in the near future because it has substantially ***improved my health***. Before I jogged, I suffered from sub-health resulting from my ***sedentary lifestyle***. I felt tightness in my chest now and then, my ***back and waist*** ached, and I could not help panting after climbing only two floors. But now, these problems rarely surface.
>
> * Apart from the ***health benefits*** I have mentioned, I enjoy jogging because it can soothe my tense nerves. You know, it helps me ***concentrate*** on my breaths and steps and thus temporarily ***escape*** from all the troubles.

在上面的回答中，加粗的字是要写在纸上的，其他部分就只能自由发挥了

### Part 3

在 part 3 时，回答的方式和 part 1 差不多，只是第一人称要换成第三人称，如 the people，they，them 和 their。讲述时按照***OREO***的方法就可以了，讲述时间不能超过 1 分钟，40 秒就足够了。举例的时候，只用举一个就可以了，越详细越好。

 **例如：Q do people's routines differ on weekdays and weekends?**

> eg.
>
> * The routines on weekdays are regular but routines on weekends are not. ***(opinion)***
> * ***(reason)***
> * For example, people have to go to school or go to the workplace at 7 am every weekday and have lunch at 12 o’clock, and they had to stay at school or work place until at about 6 PM. But on the weekends, people can get up late at around 11am if they want, having a big meal in the restaurant like the green tea restaurant for the crispy chicken and spicy tofu. And they can go home at any time they want.***(example)***
> * so the routines on weekends are flexible but on weekdays are stricted.***(opinion)***

### 如何讲好例子

* 背景（一句话）

* 4、5 个 actions ————>good example

  2、3 个 actions————>small example

* 结果，the end

  **例如：Describe the word "patience" .**

> eg.
>
> * If a naughty kid is making noise, laughing and shouting, in a public place like the library named the Book City in Nan Shan     district in Shenzhen and his parents are not there ***（background）***,
> * I will not ***get mad*** at him or ***punch*** on his face. I will first ***grab*** his hands to ***stop*** him from running around the whole place, and ***tell*** him to be quiet.  ***（actions）***
> * Then, I will ***send*** him to his parents to ***tell*** about his bad behavour, to ***make sure*** that he will not make noise in the public any more. ***（the end）***
> * 注：加粗为 actions
