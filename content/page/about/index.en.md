I am a freshman student studying at UIC. I am little bit afraid of strangers, but once I get familiar with it, I will become quite outgoing. My hobbies are playing the game named Honor of Kings and Genshin Impact, and I enjoy playing badminton and table tennis. This website is mainly for sharing my experiences in life and studies, as well as technical knowledge. If there are any mistakes, please forgive me.
